# PBL3 Smart-Parking

## Introduction
- Our products provide a solid and comprehensive foundation of expertise in the field of electronics and programming.
- We are proud to fully meet the requirements for "smart garage"
  
**The product includes two main parts**

- Hardware with ESP32, Oled screen, DC motor using Relay, AC motor using Triac, sensors.
- Software with MQTT communicating with Broker helps to bring information to the web quickly and effectively
- Each part is designed in detail, taking on separate functions, contributing to creating a complete and effective product.
## How the System Works
### System Overview:
- Differential OTL (Output Transformer-Less) power amplifier is a type of amplifier designed to amplify electrical signals without using an output transformer. 
- This helps reduce the size, weight and cost of the system.

**Differential Stage:**
- The main task is to amplify the input signal, providing separation and adjustment between signals.
- This stage uses transistors or op-amps to create a differential signal, which helps increase sensitivity and reduce noise.
  
**Boost Stage:**
- This stage has the function of boosting the signal from the differential stage to the power stage.
- It ensures that the amplified signal is strong enough to be transmitted to the power stage without degradation.
  
**Power Stage:**
- The final stage, responsible for amplifying the signal to the power level required to drive a speaker or other load.
- This stage often uses power transistors to achieve high amplification.
